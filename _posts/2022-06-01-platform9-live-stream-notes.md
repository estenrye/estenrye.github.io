## Summary

I want to build Docker images in my Kubernetes hosted VS Code Server instance.
To do this, I am going to add a sidecar container which is running the Docker
daemon using Docker-in-Docker.  Then I will add the docker-cli to my VS Code
Server image and connect it to the Docker socket in the side car.  This should
allow me to build a docker image in a browser.

## Adding the Docker-in-Docker sidecar daemon container to the pod

Steps:

1. Select Docker-in-Docker image.
2. Create a new deployment in helm chart to deploy docker-in-docker.
3. Add a service for the docker socket.
4. Add a network policy to restrict access to the docker socket to containers within the same namespace.
  - allow only vscode server pod to access dind pod.

### Step 1: Select Docker-in-Docker image.

Browse the tags at [Docker Hub: library/docker | Tags](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/?tab=tags).

I am selecting the `dind-rootless` tag, which will provide me a rootless installation of the Docker-in-Docker daemon
using the latest version of docker.  The helm chart will provide a tag override in the `values.yaml` that will allow
me to specify a more specific tag if I desire a more consistent deployment.

### Step 2: Create a new deployment in the VS Code Server helm chart.

- Got Docker-in-Docker deployed alongside vscode-server.
  - not working yet.
  - TLS Certificates are not being generated because Kubernetes Secrets mounted to paths are read-only.
