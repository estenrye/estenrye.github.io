# Dinner with Bick

Tonight, I had the enormous pleasure of hosting a good friend of mine for dinner
tonight.  Bick was in town from Huntsville, Alabama as an expert witness for a trial.
Bick and I met while I was working at Zags.  His knowledge of the insurance industry
is a thing of beauty, and he was exactly the mentor I needed in that role.  Tonight,
we had a lovely dinner and my last remaining Bordeaux wine from France.  Through all
the reminiscing, board games, and pleasant company Bick still found time to remind me
again of the three principals of life.

# The Three Principals of life

1. Life is simple, people complicate it.
2. Life is about two things, choices and relationships.
3. Life is not about what you can get, it's about what you can give.

# Spiritual Inventory

Bick is very spritual and his relationship with God runs deep.  My own spritual
relationship with God hasn't been something I have explored very deeply.  During
our time together I mentioned that management and team leadership isn't necessarily
what I set out to achieve when I joined my current employer.  At that point, he brought
up the Spiritual Gifts and suggested I look into taking a Spiritual Inventory Test.
He said everyone is blessed with at least one Spiritual Gift.  Fewer are blessed with
two or three, and fewer still are blessed with more than three.  He said that he wouldn't
be surprised if I had three.  

His task for me was to take the inventory, then take a moment of quiet reflection to
look back on the last 15 years of my life to see how my spiritual gifts put me on the
path to where I am today.  Once I'd done that, then call him.  After that, take another
moment of quiet reflection to look at where I wanted to go in the next 15 years and how
I would use my spiritual gifts to get there and then call him again.

I decided to document my exploration here.
